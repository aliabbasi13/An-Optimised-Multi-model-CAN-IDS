# Development and Comparative Evaluation of Classic and Deep Models for Intrusion Detection in In-vehicle CAN

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation and comparative evaluation of Classic and Deep Learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
for the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus. The project evaluates four models:

- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)  
- Deep Neural Network (DNN)  
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)  

The models are trained and tested on real automotive datasets to detect following diverse CAN bus attacks under uniform experimenatl framework:
- Attack free
- Denial-of-Service (DoS)  
- Fuzzy Attacks  
- Impersonation Attacks  

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature extraction (timestamp, CAN ID, DLC, data bytes).  
- Class balancing to handle benign and attack traffic.  
- Optimization techniques: hyperparameter tuning, early stopping, weight balancing, quantization.  
- Performance evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUROC, TPR, TNR, FPR and Latency.  
- Comparative analysis of ML vs. DL models under standardized conditions.
- Benchmarking with Existing Literature. 

## Datasets
- **OTIDS Dataset** (HCRL CAN Intrusion Dataset)  
- **HCRL In-Vehicle Network Intrusion Detection Challenge Dataset**  

## Results
- **DNN** achieved the best impresssive accuracy with highest computational efficiency.  
- **CNN** provided strong detection with high precision.  
- While **SVM** and **KNN** delivers high precsion but have  higher inference latency.  

## Future Work
- Testbed or FPGA Implementation.  
- Implementation of	Explainable IDS Architectures.  
- Evaluation on sophisticted Attacks generated by adversarial training methods.
